# FinalProjectUnix

This system is to be used on Debian/Ubuntu distros

This only script is only intended for the game Bleach: Brave Souls so far, available on Steam, so make sure that you have the game.

For using, launch the game, get into a mission, then press F8 when prepare quest is on screen to activate the script.
Make sure that you have auto-combat on.

This script, explained simply, takes a screenshot and uses pattern recognition to simulate mouse movement if the pattern is found in the screenshot. It then simulates mouse clicks on the patterns to make progress in the game.
It also has different conditions, for example, if you fail a quest, it returns you to the home menu of the game and ends the script, and if you pass the mission, it brings you to the next mission.

This project uses scrot to take the screenshots, and the reason why this was chosen was because unlike other tools such as xdotools which could be programmed to do inputs such as the default keys for screenshots, however it wouldn't be able to give a proper name
to the screenshot, in which the script would fetch.

Furthermore, the reason why Debian was picked over another distro such as Fedora, is because although Fedora is known to be pretty good for games and pretty good for automation as well, however it's also known for not being beginner friendly and requiring a bit more
maintenance compared to other distros like Debian.

This project span out over the period of 3 weeks and had most of it's content being added around the 3 week mark.

What I found challenging was that it was hard finding a guide, how to start as well as what to add when it came to a project like this, since it's a lot more specific at least in the design.

As for what was accomplishing, I guess being able to work on this project is gratifying as a learning experience and being able to learn more, in my opinion, is always an accomplishment.

In the future, either I or someone else could add more features such as; making this script an actual application instead of a file run in the console. It could also have more configurations like; repeat a a certain amount of times or continue until XX:XX time. It
could also be worked on to be implemented to other games.

The reason why you should use this product is because, as aforementioned, it is open to multiple modifications due to it's availability to the community making it have limitless possibilities.
