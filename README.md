# FinalProjectUnix

This system is to be used on Debian/Ubuntu distros

This only script is only intended for the game Bleach: Brave Souls so far, available on Steam, so make sure that you have the game.

For using, launch the game, get into a mission, then press F8 when prepare quest is on screen to activate the script.

This script, explained simply, takes a screenshot and uses pattern recognition to simulate mouse movement if the pattern is found in the screenshot. It then simulates mouse clicks on the patterns to make progress in the game.
It also has different conditions, for example, if you fail a quest, it returns you to the home menu of the game and ends the script, and if you pass the mission, it brings you to the next mission.
