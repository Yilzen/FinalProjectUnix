use sudo apt install in console to get the packages
-xdotool
-xbindkeys
-python3
-python3-pip
-python3-opencv
-scrot

for steam, it's more complicated and you need to use the following:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget
wget https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steam.deb
sudo dpkg -i steam.deb
sudo apt install -f
steam --version

you also need to have a steam account to have access to the game Bleach: Brave Souls

That will be all.
